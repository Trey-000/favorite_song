                <li>The lights go out and I can't be saved</li>
                <li>Tides that I tried to swim against</li>
                <li>Have brought me down upon my knees</li>
                <li>Oh, I beg, I beg and plead</li>
                <li>Singin' come out of things unsaid</li>
                <li>Shoot an apple off my head</li>
                <li>And a trouble that can't be named</li>
                <li>A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'</li>
                <li>You are</li>
                <li>You are</li>

                <li>Confusion that never stops</li>
                <li>Closing walls and ticking clocks</li>
                <li>Gonna come back and take you home</li>
                <li>I could not stop that you now know</li>
                <li>Singin' come out upon my seas</li>
                <li>Cursed missed opportunities</li>
                <li>Am I a part of the cure</li>
                <li>Or am I part of the disease? Singin'</li>
            </ul>
